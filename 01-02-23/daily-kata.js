//Currying functions: multiply all elements in an array
//
//To complete this Kata you need to make a function multiplyAll/multiply_all which takes an array of integers as an argument. This function must return another function, which takes a single integer as an argument and returns a new array. 
//The returned array should consist of each of the elements from the first array multiplied by the integer.
//Example:
//multiplyAll([1, 2, 3])(2) = [2, 4, 6];
//
//You must not mutate the original array.
//Here's a nice Youtube video about currying, which might help you if this is new to you.

function multiplyAll(arr){
    return function mutiply(multiplier) {
      return arr.map(ele => ele * multiplier)
    }
  }
