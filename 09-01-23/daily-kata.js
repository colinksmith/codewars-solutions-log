//String Scramble
//
//Given a string and an array of index numbers, return the characters of the string rearranged to be in the order specified by the accompanying array.
//Ex:
//scramble('abcd', [0,3,1,2]) -> 'acdb' 
//The string that you will be returning back will have: 'a' at index 0, 'b' at index 3, 'c' at index 1, 'd' at index 2, because the order of those characters maps to their corresponding numbers in the index array. 
//In other words, put the first character in the string at the index described by the first element of the array
//You can assume that you will be given a string and array of equal length and both containing valid characters (A-Z, a-z, or 0-9).

function scramble(str, arr) {
    let output = []
    for (let i = 0; i < str.length; i++) {
      output[arr[i]] = str[i]

    return output.join('')
