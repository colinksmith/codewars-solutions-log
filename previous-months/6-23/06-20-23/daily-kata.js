//Borrower Speak
//
//The borrowers are tiny tiny fictional people. As tiny tiny people they have to be sure they aren't spotted, or more importantly, stepped on. 
//As a result, the borrowers talk very very quietly. They find that capitals and punctuation of any sort lead them to raise their voices and put them in danger. 
//The young borrowers have begged their parents to stop using caps and punctuation.
//Change the input text s to new borrower speak. Help save the next generation!
