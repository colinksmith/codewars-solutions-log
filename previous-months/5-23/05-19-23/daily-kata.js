//Arithmetic sequence - sum of n elements
//
//In your class, you have started lessons about "arithmetic progression". Because you are also a programmer, you have decided to write a function.
//This function, arithmetic_sequence_sum(a, r, n), should return the sum of the first (n) elements of a sequence in which each element is the sum of the given integer (a), and a number of occurences of the given integer (r), based on the element's position within the sequence.
//For example:
//arithmetic_sequence_sum(2, 3, 5) should return 40:
//1     2        3          4            5
//a + (a+r) + (a+r+r) + (a+r+r+r) + (a+r+r+r+r) 
//2 + (2+3) + (2+3+3) + (2+3+3+3) + (2+3+3+3+3) = 40
//

function ArithmeticSequenceSum(a, r, n) {
    let sum = 0
    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
