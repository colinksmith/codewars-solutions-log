//The Office IV - Find a Meeting Room
//
//Your job at E-Corp is both boring and difficult. It isn't made any easier by the fact that everyone constantly wants to have a meeting with you, and that the meeting rooms are always taken!
//In this kata, you will be given an array. Each value represents a meeting room. Your job? Find the first empty one and return its index (N.B. There may be more than one empty room in some test cases). 
//'X' --> busy
//'O' --> empty
//
//If all rooms are busy, return "None available!"

function meeting(x){
    let output = x.indexOf('O')
    if (output === -1) return 'None available!'
