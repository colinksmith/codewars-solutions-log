//Billiards triangle
//
//Remember the triangle of balls in billiards? To build a classic triangle (5 levels) you need 15 balls. With 3 balls you can build a 2-level triangle, etc.
//For more examples,
//pyramid(1) == 1
//
//pyramid(3) == 2
//
//pyramid(6) == 3
//
//pyramid(10) == 4
//
//pyramid(15) == 5
//
//Write a function that takes number of balls (â‰¥ 1) and calculates how many levels you can build a triangle.

function pyramid(balls) {
    let count = 0
    let increment = 1
    while (balls >= increment) {
      balls = balls - increment
      count++
      increment++
    }
    return count
  }
