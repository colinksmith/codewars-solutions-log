//Discover The Original Price
//
//We need to write some code to return the original price of a product, the return type must be of type decimal and the number must be rounded to two decimal places.
//We will be given the sale price (discounted price), and the sale percentage, our job is to figure out the original price.
//For example:
//Given an item at $75 sale price after applying a 25% discount, the function should return the original price of that item before applying the sale percentage, which is ($100.00) of course, rounded to two decimal places.
//DiscoverOriginalPrice(75, 25) => 100.00M where 75 is the sale price (discounted price), 25 is the sale percentage and 100 is the original price

function discoverOriginalPrice(discountedPrice, salePercentage){
    return Math.round(discountedPrice / (1 - salePercentage / 100) * 100) / 100
  }
