//Coding Meetup #12 - Higher-Order Functions Series - Find GitHub admins
//
//You will be given an array of objects representing data about developers who have signed up to attend the next coding meetup that you are organising.
//Given the following input array:
//var list1 = [
//  { firstName: 'Harry', lastName: 'K.', country: 'Brazil', continent: 'Americas', age: 22, language: 'JavaScript', githubAdmin: 'yes' },
//  { firstName: 'Kseniya', lastName: 'T.', country: 'Belarus', continent: 'Europe', age: 49, language: 'Ruby', githubAdmin: 'no' },
//  { firstName: 'Jing', lastName: 'X.', country: 'China', continent: 'Asia', age: 34, language: 'JavaScript', githubAdmin: 'yes' },
//  { firstName: 'Piotr', lastName: 'B.', country: 'Poland', continent: 'Europe', age: 128, language: 'JavaScript', githubAdmin: 'no' }
//];
//
//write a function that when executed as findAdmin(list1, 'JavaScript') returns only the JavaScript developers who are GitHub admins:
//[
//  { firstName: 'Harry', lastName: 'K.', country: 'Brazil', continent: 'Americas', age: 22, language: 'JavaScript', githubAdmin: 'yes' },
//  { firstName: 'Jing', lastName: 'X.', country: 'China', continent: 'Asia', age: 34, language: 'JavaScript', githubAdmin: 'yes' }
//]
//
//Notes:
//
//The original order should be preserved.
//If there are no GitHub admin developers in a given language then return an empty array [].
//The input array will always be valid and formatted as in the example above.
//The strings representing whether someone is a GitHub admin will always be formatted as 'yes' and 'no' (all lower-case).
//The strings representing a given language will always be formatted in the same way (e.g. 'JavaScript' will always be formatted with upper-case 'J' and 'S'.

//This kata is part of the Coding Meetup series which includes a number of short and easy to follow katas which have been designed to allow mastering the use of higher-order functions. In JavaScript this includes methods like: forEach, filter, map, reduce, some, every, find, findIndex. Other approaches to solving the katas are of course possible.
//Here is the full list of the katas in the Coding Meetup series:
//Coding Meetup #1 - Higher-Order Functions Series - Count the number of JavaScript developers coming from Europe
//Coding Meetup #2 - Higher-Order Functions Series - Greet developers
//Coding Meetup #3 - Higher-Order Functions Series - Is Ruby coming?
//Coding Meetup #4 - Higher-Order Functions Series - Find the first Python developer
//Coding Meetup #5 - Higher-Order Functions Series - Prepare the count of languages
//Coding Meetup #6 - Higher-Order Functions Series - Can they code in the same language?
//Coding Meetup #7 - Higher-Order Functions Series - Find the most senior developer
//Coding Meetup #8 - Higher-Order Functions Series - Will all continents be represented?
//Coding Meetup #9 - Higher-Order Functions Series - Is the meetup age-diverse?
//Coding Meetup #10 - Higher-Order Functions Series - Create usernames
//Coding Meetup #11 - Higher-Order Functions Series - Find the average age
//Coding Meetup #12 - Higher-Order Functions Series - Find GitHub admins
//Coding Meetup #13 - Higher-Order Functions Series - Is the meetup language-diverse?
//Coding Meetup #14 - Higher-Order Functions Series - Order the food
//Coding Meetup #15 - Higher-Order Functions Series - Find the odd names
//Coding Meetup #16 - Higher-Order Functions Series - Ask for missing details
