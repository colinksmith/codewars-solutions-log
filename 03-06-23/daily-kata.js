//Especially Joyful Numbers
//
//Positive integers that are divisible exactly by the sum of their digits are called Harshad numbers. 
//The first few Harshad numbers are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 18, ...
//We are interested in Harshad numbers where the product of its digit sum s and s with the digits reversed, gives the original number n. For example consider number 1729:
//
//its digit sum, s = 1 + 7 + 2 + 9 = 19
//reversing s = 91
//and 19 * 91 = 1729 --> the number that we started with.
//
//Complete the function which tests if a positive integer n is Harshad number, and returns True if the product of its digit sum and its digit sum reversed equals n; otherwise return False.
