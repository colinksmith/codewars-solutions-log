//Ghostbusters (whitespace removal)
//
//Oh no! Ghosts have reportedly swarmed the city. It's your job to get rid of them and save the day!
//In this kata, strings represent buildings while whitespaces within those strings represent ghosts.
//So what are you waiting for? Return the building(string) without any ghosts(whitespaces)!
//Example:
//ghostBusters("Sky scra per");
//
//Should return:
//"Skyscraper"
//
//If the building contains no ghosts, return the string:
//"You just wanted my autograph didn't you?"
//

function ghostBusters(building) {
    if (!building.includes(' ')) return "You just wanted my autograph didn't you?"
