// Remove exclamation marks
// Write function RemoveExclamationMarks which removes all exclamation marks from a given string.

// Twice as old
// Your function takes two arguments:

// current father's age (years)
// current age of his son (years)
// Ð¡alculate how many years ago the father was twice as old as his son (or in how many years he will be twice as old).

function twiceAsOld(dadYearsOld, sonYearsOld) {

    return Math.abs(ageDifference - sonYearsOld)

// Grasshopper - Check for factor
// This function should test if the factor is a factor of base.

// Return true if it is a factor or false if it is not.

// About factors
// Factors are numbers you can multiply together to get another number.

// 2 and 3 are factors of 6 because: 2 * 3 = 6

// You can find a factor by dividing numbers. If the remainder is 0 then the number is a factor.
// You can use the mod operator (%) in most languages to check for a remainder
// For example 2 is not a factor of 7 because: 7 % 2 = 1

// Note: base is a non-negative number, factor is a positive number.

function checkForFactor (base, factor) {
    return base % factor === 0 ? true : false
