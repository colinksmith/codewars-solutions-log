//Strong Number (Special Numbers Series #2) 
//
//Definition
//Strong number is the number that the sum of the factorial of its digits is equal to number itself.
//For example, 145 is strong, since 1! + 4! + 5! = 1 + 24 + 120 = 145.
//Task
//Given a number, Find if it is Strong or not and return either "STRONG!!!!" or "Not Strong !!".
//Notes
//
//Number passed is always  Positive.
//Return the result as String
//
//Input >> Output Examples
//strong_num(1) ==> return "STRONG!!!!"
//
//Since, the sum of its digits' factorial (1) is equal to number itself, then its a Strong.
//strong_num(123) ==> return "Not Strong !!"
//
//Since the sum of its digits' factorial of 1! + 2! + 3! = 9 is not equal to number itself, then it's  Not Strong . 
//strong_num(2)  ==>  return "STRONG!!!!"
//
//Since the sum of its digits' factorial of 2! = 2 is equal to number itself, then its a Strong.
//strong_num(150) ==> return "Not Strong !!"
//
//Since the sum of its digits' factorial of 1! + 5! + 0! = 122 is not equal to number itself, Then it's Not Strong .
