//Javascript filter - 1
//
//While developing a website, you detect that some of the members have troubles logging in. Searching through the code you find that all logins ending with a "_" make problems. So you want to write a function that takes an array of pairs of login-names and e-mails, and outputs an array of all login-name, e-mails-pairs from the login-names that end with "_".
//If you have the input-array:
//[ [ "foo", "foo@foo.com" ], [ "bar_", "bar@bar.com" ] ]
//
//it should output
//[ [ "bar_", "bar@bar.com" ] ]
//
//You have to use the filter-method which returns each element of the array for which the filter-method returns true.

function searchNames( logins ){
    return logins.filter(arr => {
      return arr[0][arr[0].length - 1] === '_'
    })
  }
