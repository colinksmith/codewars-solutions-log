// Will there be enough space?
// The Story:
// Bob is working as a bus driver. However, he has become extremely popular amongst the city's residents. With so many passengers wanting to get aboard his bus, he sometimes has to face the problem of not enough space left on the bus! He wants you to write a simple program telling him if he will be able to fit all the passengers.

// Task Overview:
// You have to write a function that accepts three parameters:

// cap is the amount of people the bus can hold excluding the driver.
// on is the number of people on the bus excluding the driver.
// wait is the number of people waiting to get on to the bus excluding the driver.
// If there is enough space, return 0, and if there isn't, return the number of passengers he can't take.

// Usage Examples:
// cap = 10, on = 5, wait = 5 --> 0 # He can fit all 5 passengers
// cap = 100, on = 60, wait = 50 --> 10 # He can't fit 10 of the 50 waiting

function enough(cap, on, wait) {
    if (wait + on < cap) {
        return 0
    } else {
        return wait + on - cap
    }
}

// Quarter of the year
// Given a month as an integer from 1 to 12, return to which quarter of the year it belongs as an integer number.

// For example: month 2 (February), is part of the first quarter; month 6 (June), is part of the second quarter; and month 11 (November), is part of the fourth quarter.

const quarterOf = (month) => {
    return Math.ceil(month / 3)
}

// Parse nice int from char problem
// You ask a small girl,"How old are you?" She always says, "x years old", where x is a random number between 0 and 9.

// Write a program that returns the girl's age (0-9) as an integer.

// Assume the test input string is always a valid string. For example, the test input may be "1 year old" or "5 years old". The first character in the string is always a number.

function getAge(inputString){
    return Number(inputString[0])
}

// Is it even?
// In this Kata we are passing a number (n) into a function.

// Your code will determine if the number passed is even (or not).

// The function needs to return either a true or false.

// Numbers may be positive or negative, integers or floats.

// Floats with decimal part non equal to zero are considered UNeven for this kata.

function testEven(n) {
    return n % 2 === 0 ? true : false
}

// Hex to Decimal
// Complete the function which converts hex number (given as a string) to a decimal number.

function hexToDec(hexString){
    return parseInt(hexString, 16)
}
