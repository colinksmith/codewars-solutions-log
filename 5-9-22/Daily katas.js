// Expressions Matter
// Given three integers a ,b ,c, return the largest number obtained after inserting the following operators and brackets: +, *, ()
// In other words , try every combination of a,b,c with [*+()] , and return the Maximum Obtained
// Consider an Example :
// With the numbers are 1, 2 and 3 , here are some ways of placing signs and brackets:

// 1 * (2 + 3) = 5
// 1 * 2 * 3 = 6
// 1 + 2 * 3 = 7
// (1 + 2) * 3 = 9
// So the maximum value that you can obtain is 9.

// Notes
// The numbers are always positive.
// The numbers are in the range (1  ≤  a, b, c  ≤  10).
// You can use the same operation more than once.
// It's not necessary to place all the signs and brackets.
// Repetition in numbers may occur .
// You cannot swap the operands. For instance, in the given example you cannot get expression (1 + 3) * 2 = 8.
// Input >> Output Examples:
// expressionsMatter(1,2,3)  ==>  return 9
// Explanation:
// After placing signs and brackets, the Maximum value obtained from the expression (1+2) * 3 = 9.

// expressionsMatter(1,1,1)  ==>  return 3
// Explanation:
// After placing signs, the Maximum value obtained from the expression is 1 + 1 + 1 = 3.

// expressionsMatter(9,1,1)  ==>  return 18
// Explanation:
// After placing signs and brackets, the Maximum value obtained from the expression is 9 * (1+1) = 18.

// Powers of 2
// Complete the function that takes a non-negative integer n as input, and returns a list of all the powers of 2 with the exponent ranging from 0 to n ( inclusive ).

// n = 0  ==> [1]        # [2^0]
// n = 1  ==> [1, 2]     # [2^0, 2^1]
// n = 2  ==> [1, 2, 4]  # [2^0, 2^1, 2^2]
