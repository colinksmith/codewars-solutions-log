// Expressions Matter
// Given three integers a ,b ,c, return the largest number obtained after inserting the following operators and brackets: +, *, ()
// In other words , try every combination of a,b,c with [*+()] , and return the Maximum Obtained
// Consider an Example :
// With the numbers are 1, 2 and 3 , here are some ways of placing signs and brackets:

// 1 * (2 + 3) = 5
// 1 * 2 * 3 = 6
// 1 + 2 * 3 = 7
// (1 + 2) * 3 = 9
// So the maximum value that you can obtain is 9.

// Notes
// The numbers are always positive.
// The numbers are in the range (1  ≤  a, b, c  ≤  10).
// You can use the same operation more than once.
// It's not necessary to place all the signs and brackets.
// Repetition in numbers may occur .
// You cannot swap the operands. For instance, in the given example you cannot get expression (1 + 3) * 2 = 8.
// Input >> Output Examples:
// expressionsMatter(1,2,3)  ==>  return 9
// Explanation:
// After placing signs and brackets, the Maximum value obtained from the expression (1+2) * 3 = 9.

// expressionsMatter(1,1,1)  ==>  return 3
// Explanation:
// After placing signs, the Maximum value obtained from the expression is 1 + 1 + 1 = 3.

// expressionsMatter(9,1,1)  ==>  return 18
// Explanation:
// After placing signs and brackets, the Maximum value obtained from the expression is 9 * (1+1) = 18.

// Volume of a Cuboid
// Bob needs a fast way to calculate the volume of a cuboid with three values: length, width and the height of the cuboid. Write a function to help Bob with this calculation.

// Powers of 2
// Complete the function that takes a non-negative integer n as input, and returns a list of all the powers of 2 with the exponent ranging from 0 to n ( inclusive ).

// Examples
// n = 0  ==> [1]        # [2^0]
// n = 1  ==> [1, 2]     # [2^0, 2^1]
// n = 2  ==> [1, 2, 4]  # [2^0, 2^1, 2^2]

    }

}

// What is between?
// Complete the function that takes two integers (a, b, where a < b) and return an array of all integers between the input parameters, including them.

// For example:

// a = 1
// b = 4
// --> [1, 2, 3, 4]

// Holiday VIII - Duty Free
// The purpose of this kata is to work out just how many bottles of duty free whiskey you would have to buy such that the saving over the normal high street price would effectively cover the cost of your holiday.

// You will be given the high street price (normPrice), the duty free discount (discount) and the cost of the holiday.

// For example, if a bottle cost £10 normally and the discount in duty free was 10%, you would save £1 per bottle. If your holiday cost £500, the answer you should return would be 500.

// All inputs will be integers. Please return an integer. Round down.

function dutyFree(normPrice, discount, hol){
    return Math.floor(hol / (normPrice * discount / 100))

// Convert to Binary
// Task Overview
// Given a non-negative integer n, write a function to_binary/ToBinary which returns that number in a binary format.

// to_binary(1)  /* should return 1 */
// to_binary(5)  /* should return 101 */
// to_binary(11) /* should return 1011 */
// Example:

// toBinary(1)  /* should return 1 */
// toBinary(5)  /* should return 101 */
// toBinary(11) /* should return 1011 */

function toBinary(n){
    return Number(n.toString(2))
