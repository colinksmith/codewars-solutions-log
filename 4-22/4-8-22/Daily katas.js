// Who is going to pay for the wall?
// Don Drumphet lives in a nice neighborhood, but one of his neighbors has started to let his house go. Don Drumphet wants to build a wall between his house and his neighbor’s, and is trying to get the neighborhood association to pay for it. He begins to solicit his neighbors to petition to get the association to build the wall. Unfortunately for Don Drumphet, he cannot read very well, has a very limited attention span, and can only remember two letters from each of his neighbors’ names. As he collects signatures, he insists that his neighbors keep truncating their names until two letters remain, and he can finally read them.

// Your code will show Full name of the neighbor and the truncated version of the name as an array. If the number of the characters in name is less than or equal to two, it will return an array containing only the name as is"

function whoIsPaying(name){
  let shortName = name.slice(0, 2)
  if (name.length <=2) {
    return [shortName]
  }
  return [name, shortName]
}

// Remove the time
// You're re-designing a blog and the blog's posts have the following format for showing the date and time a post was made:

// Weekday Month Day, time e.g., Friday May 2, 7pm

// You're running out of screen real estate, and on some pages you want to display a shorter format, Weekday Month Day that omits the time.

// Write a function, shortenToDate, that takes the Website date/time in its original string format, and returns the shortened format.

// Assume shortenToDate's input will always be a string, e.g. "Friday May 2, 7pm". Assume shortenToDate's output will be the shortened string, e.g., "Friday May 2".

function shortenToDate(longDate) {
  return longDate.split(',')[0]
}
// A Strange Trip to the Market
// You're on your way to the market when you hear beautiful music coming from a nearby street performer. The notes come together like you wouln't believe as the musician puts together patterns of tunes. As you wonder what kind of algorithm you could use to shift octaves by 8 pitches or something silly like that, it dawns on you that you have been watching the musician for some 10 odd minutes. You ask, "how much do people normally tip for something like this?" The artist looks up. "It's always gonna be about tree fiddy."

// It was then that you realize the musician was a 400 foot tall beast from the paleolithic era! The Loch Ness Monster almost tricked you!

// There are only 2 guaranteed ways to tell if you are speaking to The Loch Ness Monster: A) it is a 400 foot tall beast from the paleolithic era; B) it will ask you for tree fiddy.

// Since Nessie is a master of disguise, the only way accurately tell is to look for the phrase "tree fiddy". Since you are tired of being grifted by this monster, the time has come to code a solution for finding The Loch Ness Monster. Note that the phrase can also be written as "3.50" or "three fifty".

function isLockNessMonster(s) {
  if (s.includes('three fifty') || s.includes('tree fiddy') ||s.includes('3.50')) {
    return true
  } else {
    return false
  }
}
