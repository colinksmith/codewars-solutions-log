//Happy Birthday, Darling!
//
//As you may know, once some people pass their teens, they jokingly only celebrate their 20th or 21st birthday, forever. With some maths skills, that's totally possible - you only need to select the correct number base!
//For example, if they turn 32, that's exactly 20 - in base 16... Already 39? That's just 21, in base 19!
//Your task is to translate the given age to the much desired 20 (or 21) years, and indicate the number base, in the format specified below.
//Note: input will be always > 21
//Examples:
//32  -->  "32? That's just 20, in base 16!"
//39  -->  "39? That's just 21, in base 19!"
//
//Hint: if you don't know (enough) about numeral systems and radix, just observe the pattern!
