# Codewars Solutions Log
Every day I do a codewars challenge to practice my skills and broaden my knowledge. I always start my workday by doing at least one challenge, and most importantly I examine how other people solved the same problems problems I'm solving. This helps me build my fundamentals of coding, and exposes me to new and creative ways of tackling new challenges. I'm a problem solver at heart, and this is one of the highlights of my day.

## What's in here:

I have problems organized by date and month, sometimes with several solutions and questions in the same file. Originally I used chrome debugger to debug problems when they needed it, which is why every .js file has an accompanying .html file, but now I use VS Code's built in debugger. I created a node file to webscrape the problem's description and examples and create it as a file to improve both my workflow and organization, which I still use, which is why even current dates have a .html file.

## Lessons Learned:

No matter what your experience level, being an engineer means continuously learning. Whenever I come across a problem with a solution dramatically different than mine, I bookmark it so that I can come back and practice spaced repetition and learn that solution for future problems. I've already noticed improvement on both the breath and depth of the types of problems that I feel I can solve.

This was also one of the first experiences working with the fs node module, which is used to edit local files. This simple script has saved me hours of tedious copying and pasting, and undoubtedly countless typos. It also makes the work more fun for me, which is the most important part.
