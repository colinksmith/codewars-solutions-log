//Coding Meetup #14 - Higher-Order Functions Series - Order the food
//
//You will be given an array of objects representing data about developers who have signed up to attend the next coding meetup that you are organising.
//Your task is to return an object which includes the count of food options selected by the developers on the meetup sign-up form..
//For example, given the following input array:
//var list1 = [
//  { firstName: 'Noah', lastName: 'M.', country: 'Switzerland', continent: 'Europe', age: 19, language: 'C', 
//    meal: 'vegetarian' },
//  { firstName: 'Anna', lastName: 'R.', country: 'Liechtenstein', continent: 'Europe', age: 52, language: 'JavaScript', 
//    meal: 'standard' },
//  { firstName: 'Ramona', lastName: 'R.', country: 'Paraguay', continent: 'Americas', age: 29, language: 'Ruby', 
//    meal: 'vegan' },
//  { firstName: 'George', lastName: 'B.', country: 'England', continent: 'Europe', age: 81, language: 'C', 
//    meal: 'vegetarian' },
//];
//
//your function should return the following object (the order of properties does not matter):
//{ vegetarian: 2, standard: 1, vegan: 1 }
//
//Notes:
//
//The order of the meals count in the object does not matter. 
//The count value should be a valid number.
//The input array will always be valid and formatted as in the example above.
//there are 5 possible meal options and the strings representing the selected meal option will always be formatted in the same way, as follows: 'standard',  'vegetarian', 'vegan', 'diabetic', 'gluten-intolerant'.

//This kata is part of the Coding Meetup series which includes a number of short and easy to follow katas which have been designed to allow mastering the use of higher-order functions. In JavaScript this includes methods like: forEach, filter, map, reduce, some, every, find, findIndex. Other approaches to solving the katas are of course possible.
//Here is the full list of the katas in the Coding Meetup series:
//Coding Meetup #1 - Higher-Order Functions Series - Count the number of JavaScript developers coming from Europe
//Coding Meetup #2 - Higher-Order Functions Series - Greet developers
//Coding Meetup #3 - Higher-Order Functions Series - Is Ruby coming?
//Coding Meetup #4 - Higher-Order Functions Series - Find the first Python developer
//Coding Meetup #5 - Higher-Order Functions Series - Prepare the count of languages
//Coding Meetup #6 - Higher-Order Functions Series - Can they code in the same language?
//Coding Meetup #7 - Higher-Order Functions Series - Find the most senior developer
//Coding Meetup #8 - Higher-Order Functions Series - Will all continents be represented?
//Coding Meetup #9 - Higher-Order Functions Series - Is the meetup age-diverse?
//Coding Meetup #10 - Higher-Order Functions Series - Create usernames
//Coding Meetup #11 - Higher-Order Functions Series - Find the average age
//Coding Meetup #12 - Higher-Order Functions Series - Find GitHub admins
//Coding Meetup #13 - Higher-Order Functions Series - Is the meetup language-diverse?
//Coding Meetup #14 - Higher-Order Functions Series - Order the food
//Coding Meetup #15 - Higher-Order Functions Series - Find the odd names
//Coding Meetup #16 - Higher-Order Functions Series - Ask for missing details
