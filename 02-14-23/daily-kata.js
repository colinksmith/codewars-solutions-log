//Nth Root of a Number
//
//Given two numbers x and n, calculate the (positive) nth root of x; this means that being r = result, r^n = x
//Examples
//x = 4     n = 2  -->  2    # the square root of 4 is 2     2^2 = 4
//x = 8     n = 3  -->  2    # the cube root of 8 is 2       2^3 = 8
//x = 256   n = 4  -->  4    # the 4th root of 256 is 4      4^4 = 256
//x = 9     n = 2  -->  3    # the square root of 9 is 3     3^2 = 9
//x = 6.25  n = 2  -->  2.5  #                             2.5^2 = 6.25
//
//Notes:
//
//4 <= x < 10 ^ 20
//4 <= n <= 50
//
//Good luck!
