//Grasshopper - Create the rooms
//
//Escape the room
//You are creating an "Escape the room" game. The first step is to create a hash table called rooms that contains all of the rooms of the game. There should be at least 3 rooms inside it, each being a hash table with at least three properties (e.g. name, description, completed).

var rooms = {
    room1: {name: 'room1', description: 'the first room', completed: false},
    room2: {name: 'room1', description: 'the first room', completed: false},
    room3: {name: 'room1', description: 'the first room', completed: false},
  
  }
