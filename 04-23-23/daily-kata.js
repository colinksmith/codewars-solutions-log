//Interactive Dictionary
//
//In this kata, your job is to create a class Dictionary which you can add words to and their entries. Example:
//>>> d = Dictionary()
//
//>>> d.newentry('Apple', 'A fruit that grows on trees')
//
//>>> print(d.look('Apple'))
//A fruit that grows on trees
//
//>>> print(d.look('Banana'))
//Can't find entry for Banana
//
//Good luck and happy coding!
