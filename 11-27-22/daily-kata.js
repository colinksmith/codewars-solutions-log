//Looking for a benefactor
//
//The accounts of the "Fat to Fit Club (FFC)" association are supervised by John as a volunteered accountant.
//The association is funded through financial donations from generous benefactors. John has a list of
//the first n donations: [14, 30, 5, 7, 9, 11, 15]
//He wants to know how much the next benefactor should give to the association so that the 
//average of the first n + 1 donations should reach an average of 30.
//After doing the math he found 149. He thinks that he could have made a mistake.
//if dons = [14, 30, 5, 7, 9, 11, 15] then new_avg(dons, 30) --> 149
//Could you help him?
//Task
//The function new_avg(arr, navg) should return the expected donation
//(rounded up to the next integer) that will permit to reach the average navg. 
//Should the last donation be a non positive number (<= 0) John wants us: 
//
//to return:
//
//Nothing in Haskell, Elm
//None in F#, Ocaml, Rust, Scala
//-1 in C, D, Fortran,  Nim, PowerShell, Go, Pascal, Prolog, Lua, Perl, Erlang
//
//
//or to throw an error (some examples for such a case):
//
//IllegalArgumentException() in Clojure, Java
//ArgumentException() in C#
//echo ERROR in Shell
//argument-error in Racket
//std::invalid_argument in C++
//ValueError in Python
//
//
//
//So, he will clearly see that his expectations are not great enough. 
//In "Sample Tests" you can see what to return.
//Notes:
//
//all donations and navg are numbers (integers or floats), arr can be empty.
//See examples below and "Sample Tests" to see which return is to be done.
//
//new_avg([14, 30, 5, 7, 9, 11, 15], 92) should return 645
//new_avg([14, 30, 5, 7, 9, 11, 15], 2) 
//should raise an error (ValueError or invalid_argument or argument-error or DomainError or ... ) 
//or return `-1` or ERROR or Nothing or None depending on the language.
//
